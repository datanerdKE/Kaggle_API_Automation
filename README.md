Certainly! I've added the commands for searching the dataset and downloading it using the Kaggle API to the README:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- MySQL
- Necessary Python packages (you can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Python script to extract, load, and clean the data. Make sure to update the necessary database connection details.

```bash
python data_processing_script.py
```

### Search for the Dataset

To search for the dataset on Kaggle, use the following command:

```bash
kaggle datasets list -s 'Data Analyst Job Postings [Pay, Skills, Benefits]'
```

### Download the Dataset

To download the dataset using the Kaggle API, run:

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d 'lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search'
```

## Database Connection

Uncomment and update the following lines in the script to connect to your MySQL database:

```python
# db = mysql.connector.connect(user='your-username', database='your-database', password='your-password')
# cursor = db.cursor()
# cursor.execute('create database gsearch_jobs')
# cursor.close()
# db.close()
```

Update the MySQL engine connection string:

```python
mysql_engine = create_engine('mysql://your-username:your-password@localhost:3306/gsearch_jobs')
```

## Data Cleaning

The script performs basic data cleaning, dropping unnecessary columns from the dataset.

## Export to Database

The cleaned dataset is exported to the local MySQL database.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username`, `your-repository`, `your-database`, `your-password`, and `[Your License Name]` with the actual values. These commands can be executed in the terminal or command prompt as needed.
